 # Advantages of used Block-Recurrent Transformer (BRT) in Crypto Trend Prediction over other algorithms:
 1) Parallelization: Theses allow for parallelization of computation.
 2) Scalability: These transformers can scale to handle sequences of varying lengths.
 3) Sequential Information Processing: These RNNs naturally capture sequential dependencies in data, which can be important for certain tasks.
 4) Sequential Information Processing: These RNNs naturally capture sequential dependencies in data, which can be important for certain tasks.
 5) Better Performance and realistic prediction: Depending on the specific problem and data characteristics.

# Problems faced:
1) High training time.
2) Difficult to implement due to lack of research and tooling.
3) High utilization of resources.
